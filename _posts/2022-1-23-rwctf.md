## Introduction
The Real Wolrd CTF was a insane experience with a lot of challenges(web,pwd,rev and some combined) my team and I finished top 51 placement in the scoreboard and we won the digital souvenirs(nft) for each challenge. For me it was the first time that i participated in Real World CTF but everything went very well, we did better than I expected and the position we finished was very good compared to other teams.
